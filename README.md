# Hill-Climb-Bike-Race-Prototype

You control a motorcycle which moves over a randomly generated 2D terrain. The motorcycle have suspension on both wheels. If you tap on the right side of the screen, the motorcycle accelerates, if you tap on the left side - it slows down. In the top left corner of the screen, there is a text with the distance that the motorcycle has traveled. If the motorcycle makes a wheelie, a “Wheelie!” text appears in the right top corner. If the motorcycle falls over, the game automatically restarts. The look &amp; feel of the game correct on any screen resolution.
